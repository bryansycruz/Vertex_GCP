      "The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh Scattering**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each of these colors has a different wavelength.\n",
      "    *   **Shorter Wavelengths:** Blue and violet light have shorter, smaller wavelengths.\n",
      "    *   **Longer Wavelengths:** Red and orange light have longer, larger wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is composed mainly of tiny nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂) molecules. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Rayleigh Scattering:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with these tiny air molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Preferential Scattering:** Because the air molecules are so small, they are much more effective at scattering shorter-wavelength light (blue and violet) than longer-wavelength light (red, orange, yellow). Think of it like hitting a small pebble with a small wave versus a large wave – the small wave gets deflected more easily.\n",
      "    *   **All Directions:** This scattered blue and violet light gets sent in all directions across the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Why We See Blue (and not Violet):**\n",
      "    *   While violet light is scattered even *more* than blue light, there are two main reasons why the sky appears blue:\n",
      "        *   The Sun emits more blue light than violet light.\n",
      "        *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light.\n",
      "    *   So, a combination of more available blue light and our eyes' sensitivity means we perceive the scattered light as predominantly blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **What We See:** When you look up at the sky during the day, you are seeing this blue light that has been scattered towards your eyes from all angles. The direct sunlight that reaches your eyes (which is why the sun itself looks yellowish-white when high in the sky) has had a good portion of its blue and violet components scattered away.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** The tiny molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter blue light more efficiently than other colors. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bonus - Why Sunsets are Red/Orange:**\n",
      "When the sun is low on the horizon (sunrise or sunset), its light has to travel through a much greater amount of atmosphere to reach our eyes. By the time it gets to us, most of the blue and violet light has been scattered away, leaving primarily the longer-wavelength red, orange, and yellow light to pass directly through, creating those beautiful sunset colors.\n"

      " come from all parts of the sky. Wherever you look, you're seeing this scattered blue light.\n",
      "    *   The longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) tend to pass through the atmosphere more directly, without as much scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Why Not Violet?** While violet light is scattered even *\n",
      "more* than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and there's also less violet light in the sun's spectrum to begin with. So, we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Related Phenomena:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sunrise and Sunset:** When the sun is low on the horizon (\n",
      "sunrise or sunset), its light has to travel through a much thicker slice of atmosphere. By the time it reaches your eyes, most of the blue light has been scattered away, leaving more of the longer-wavelength red, orange, and yellow light to reach our eyes directly, creating those beautiful hues.\n",
      "*   **Why\n",
      " Space is Black:** In space, there's no atmosphere to scatter sunlight. The light travels directly from the sun, which is why space looks black, and the sun appears as a brilliant, unscattered white disk.\n",
      "*   **Why Clouds are White/Gray:** Clouds are made of much larger water droplets\n",

      "In a kingdom nestled between towering, snow-capped peaks and a sea that whispered ancient secrets, lived an Emperor who loved beauty above all else. His palace was a marvel of jade and gold, his gardens bloomed with flowers from every corner of the world, and his halls echoed with the finest music. Yet, his greatest treasure was not a jewel or a painting, but a small, exquisite clockwork nightingale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crafted by the most ingenious artisan in the land, this bird was a masterpiece of polished brass, tiny gears, and sapphire eyes. When wound, it would perch on a velvet cushion and sing. Its song was perfect, a cascade of notes so precise, so flawless, that it brought tears to the Emperor's eyes. Every trill, every warble, was exactly the same, day after day, year after year. The Emperor would sit for hours, listening, convinced he possessed the most beautiful sound in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a traveler from a distant land arrived at the palace, bearing tales of wonders. Among them, he spoke of a *real* nightingale, a small, brown bird that lived in the Emperor's own wild forest, whose song was said to be so enchanting it could mend broken hearts and stir the very soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrigued, the Emperor sent his courtiers to find this creature. They returned with a tiny, unassuming bird, its feathers dull compared to the clockwork marvel. But when the real nightingale opened its beak and sang, a hush fell over the entire court. Its song was not perfect; it faltered sometimes, soared unexpectedly, and carried a raw, untamed beauty that the clockwork bird, for all its precision, could never replicate. It sang of the rustling leaves, the scent of rain, the vastness of the sky, and the quiet joy of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Emperor was captivated. He forgot his clockwork nightingale, leaving it unwound and silent on its velvet cushion. For weeks, he listened only to the real bird, until one morning, it flew out of an open window, back to its wild forest, never to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great sadness fell upon the Emperor. He missed the wild, unpredictable song, but he also found he could no longer find joy in the clockwork bird's perfect, unchanging melody. It felt hollow, a mere echo of what he had once cherished. He grew ill, his once vibrant spirit fading like a dying ember.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Emperor lay on his silken bed, pale and weak, the whispers of his impending end spread through the palace. Even Death, a silent, cloaked figure, was said to be waiting in the shadows of his chamber.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Eyes:** The cat has striking **amber or yellowish-green eyes** that are looking directly at the viewer, giving it an alert and curious expression.\n",
      "*   **Pose:** It is standing with its body slightly turned to the right, but its head is swiveled to face forward. One of its front paws (the left one from its perspective) is delicately lifted off the snow, suggesting it has just paused or is about to take another step. Its tail is striped and held somewhat low.\n",
      "*   **Setting:** The ground is covered in a thick, pristine layer of **white snow**. The snow appears soft and powdery.\n",
      "*   **Background:** The background is also entirely snow, but it is softly blurred, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the cat sharply in focus. There are no other discernible objects in the background, just an expanse of white.\n",
      "*   **Lighting:** The scene is brightly lit, suggesting a clear, possibly sunny day, which highlights the cat's fur and the texture of the snow.\n",
